# Lab-05-First-Semester-Number-of-1s-in-the-binary-rep-of-a-number-using-Bitwise-operators

We were assigned this question in Lab 05 of our Programming Fundamentals course (first semester). The task required us to take a number as input from the user and then count the number of 1s in its binary representation using bitwise operators. We had to write a program for this in the C language.


Question: Create a program that counts the number of 1s in the binary representation of a number.
